# Service
Service is a caching utility for ROBLOX which goal is to achieve the ~~best perfomance~~ and experience, while working with services.
> [!CAUTION]
> The performance difference is minimal, and this utility may be slower than if you receive the service manually. This is due to the fact that `GetService` is processed in C++ with a [singleton-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) structure. Although you still have the option of using it to keep the caching with an additional `clonereference` function.

# Installation
- This utility was created with [darklua](https://github.com/seaofvoices/darklua) compatibility and assumed to have the same compatibility when used. <br/>
- To preserve the typization when using it, it is recommended to [copy the repository](https://docs.github.com/ru/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to use the files separately. <br/>
- Otherwise, you have the option to [download the release version](https://github.com/lorevity/Service/releases/download/v0.0.1/service.luau) for future reference.

# Usage
- The utility itself is very simple and easy to use.
- To access a service, you simply need to specify its name and the utility itself will cache and return the service.
```lua
local ServiceUtil = require("@utils/service") -- Alias/service.luau
print(ServiceUtil.ReplicatedFirst) -- Output: ReplicatedFirst
```

# Advice
> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended to localize services each time you access them more than once. This will improve performance better than if it's done only by a utility.
```lua
local ServiceUtil = require("@utils/service")

local Players = service.Players
local CoreGui = service.CoreGui

while task.wait() do
    print(`Cached services: {Players}, {CoreGui}`)
end
```
> [!CAUTION]
> It's highly advised not to access the services each time without localizing them. Especially if you do it in a loop or connection. Either way it will lead to processing of the cached services through the table each time, which will cause deterioration in perfomance.
```lua
local ServiceUtil = require("@utils/service")

while task.wait() do
    print(ServiceUtil.Workspace)
end
```
